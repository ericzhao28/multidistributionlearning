# On-Demand Sampling: Learning Optimally from Multiple Distributions

This is an early-release of the code used in the experiments of the Neurips 2022 paper [On-Demand Sampling:
Learning Optimally from Multiple Distributions (HJZ 22)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12529).

### Instructions
First, download the Waterbirds, MultiNLI, and CelebA datasets to the root of this project.
Then, run `ready.sh`, which will call `run.sh`.
The latter script will run the experiments.
When complete, the paper's figures can be reproduced by running the `generate_paper_results.py` script.
